#include "subsystem/platform/CharDefs.h"

//
// The ::subsystem::LogWriter class defines abstract low-level interface for logging
// (recording various types of events in software components or applications).
//
// To develop an implementation (e.g. a ::subsystem::LogWriter which writes to a file, to the
// console etc.), inherit from this class and override its print() function.
// For example, see FileLogWriter which implements the ::subsystem::LogWriter interface to log
// into a file.
//
// Normally, this class and its subclasses should not be used directly. It's
// recommended to use ::subsystem::LogWriter which adds separate functions for different
// log verbosity levels, and adds scopedstrMessage formatting.
//
// When developing components and libraries that use logging but should stay
// independent from the actual logging method, allow passing ::subsystem::LogWriter* pointer
// to your module and construct ::subsystem::LogWriter wrapper around that ::subsystem::LogWriter. That
// allows your caller to pass any sub-class of the ::subsystem::LogWriter to your component,
// or operate without logging by passing a null pointer.
//
class ::subsystem::LogWriter
{
public:
  //
  // Implementations of this abstract function should process a log event (for
  // example, print it, send it somewhere, or record it in some type of
  // storage).
  //
  // The line argument is the string to be logged.
  //
  // The logLevel argument defines significance of the event. Higher values of
  // logLevel correspond to less important events. The recommended range for
  // logLevel is 0..9. When this function is called, a ::subsystem::LogWriter implementation
  // should check logLevel and decide either to accept or to decline the log
  // scopedstrMessage.
  //
  virtual void print(int logLevel, const ::scoped_string & scopedstrLine) = 0;

  //
  // Implementations of this abstract function should return true if they ready
  // to process a scopedstrMessage with this logLevel. That is you can test messages for
  // for accepting or declining before calling the print() function.
  //
  virtual bool acceptsLevel(int logLevel) = 0;
